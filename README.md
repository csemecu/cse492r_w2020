# Write-up for Assignment 1
  - Summarize what you learned from this assignment. You may include screen captures to show your completed work(if necessary).
    - Getting use to github specific terms such as pull request. I'm more used to gitlab's merge request, which is essentially serves the same purpose (but details are a bit different). 
    - Revisit the fundamental workflow of using git.
  - Mention how this assignment will benefit you and/or your team working as part of a Robocup@Home team.
    - The assignment didn't include any new information for me personally, but I think it is important to make sure everybody is on the same page when it comes to using a version control system.
    - 
    - Managing complexity in software development in a team environment is very hard problem. I'm been tasked to work as a project manager for a while and getting everyone in each team on the same page on how to use the company's gitlab instance and how we organize information on each projects and groups is not easy. To have a better communication and organization scheme in Robocup@Home team, I think knowing the fundamentals and specifics of the platform in-use(ie. github) is important.
